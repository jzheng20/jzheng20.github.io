I am currently a Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and co-supervised by Prof. Xiaoqin Zhang and
Prof. [Xianta Jiang](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~xiantaj/). My current research interests include low-rank recovery, sparse representation learning, explainable deep neural networks, and their mathematical foundation. And I am also interested in studying math discovery in machine learning in the future.
