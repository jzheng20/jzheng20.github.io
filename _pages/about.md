*<strong><font size=3> “Theory without practice is empty, but equally, practice without theory is blind."  ---- I. Kant </font></strong>*

Hello! My name is Jingjing Zheng. My current research interests include efficient training/inference of large models grounded in theory, low-rank/sparse representation
learning with applications to efficient optimization and compute,  safety & reliability of LLMs under
resource constraints. My academic background spans art and design (B.A.), mathematics (M.S. and Ph.D.), and computer science (Ph.D.). Since 2023, I have been pursuing my doctoral studies in Mathematics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), under the supervision of Prof. [Yankai Cao](https://chbe.ubc.ca/yankai-cao/).
