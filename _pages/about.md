*<strong><font size=3> “Theory without practice is empty, but equally, practice without theory is blind."  ---- I. Kant </font></strong>*

Hello! My name is Jingjing Zheng. My current research interests include low-rank and sparse representation learning, explainable deep neural networks, their mathematical foundation, optimization in machine learning, , as well as compression and fine-tuning of large models. Since 2023, I have been pursuing my doctoral studies in Mathematics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), under the supervision of Prof. [Yankai Cao](https://chbe.ubc.ca/yankai-cao/).


If you'd like to learn more about my academic and professional background, you can take a look at my [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/jzheng20/jzheng20.github.io/tree/master/files/CV-JingjingZheng.pdf).
