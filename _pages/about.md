 Her current research interest are mainly about low rank-sparse representation learning and its application in data analysis and computer vision. The goal of low rank-sparse representation learning methods (such as PCA) is to exploit the intrinsic relationship of data samples, which have been widely applied in many fields such as data processing and data dimension reduction. And I am also interested in studying explainable deep learning and math discovery in machine learning in the future.
