I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. My current research interests include low-rank recovery, sparse representation learning, explainable deep neural networks, and their mathematical foundation. And I am also interested in studying math discovery in machine learning in the future.
