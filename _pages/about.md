My current research interest are mainly about low rank-sparse representation learning and its application in data analysis and computer vision. And I am also interested in studying explainable deep learning and math discovery in machine learning in the future. For more information, please check my [CV.pdf](https://jzheng20.github.io/files/CV-JingjingZheng.pdf)
