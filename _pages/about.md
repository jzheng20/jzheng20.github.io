My current research interest are mainly about low rank-sparse representation learning and its application in data analysis and computer vision. And I am also interested in studying explainable deep learning and math discovery in machine learning in the future. For more information, please check my [CV.pdf](https://jzheng20.github.io/files/CV-JingjingZheng.pdf)

New and Recent Events:

I have recently received Mitacs Accelerate Award with Verafin for a project related to my PhD thesis research entitled "Unsupervised Financial Fraud Detection Using Low-rank Recovery", starting May 1, 2022.

I have recently received Outstanding reseach award (Ph.D.), MUN, 2022.03.
